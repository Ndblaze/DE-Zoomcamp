🔍 Example Project: Global Earthquake Monitoring & Analysis
📦 1. Dataset Selection
Choose an open dataset from these sources:

USGS Earthquake Data – Real-time and historical global earthquake data in GeoJSON format.

Kaggle Alternative: "Earthquake Database"

Sample fields:

time, latitude, longitude, depth, mag (magnitude), place, type, etc.

🔄 2. Pipeline: Raw Data → Data Lake
Set up an ETL pipeline to ingest the data and store it in a Data Lake (e.g., AWS S3, GCP GCS, Azure Blob).

Tech Stack:

Ingestion Script: Python + requests (to call USGS API)

Orchestration: Airflow, Prefect, or Kestra

Storage: Parquet/CSV in S3/GCS/Blob

Steps:

Schedule a daily job to pull data from the USGS feed

Store as partitioned Parquet files in s3://earthquake-data/raw/yyyy/mm/dd/

📤 3. Pipeline: Data Lake → Data Warehouse
Use a tool like Airbyte, Fivetran, or Spark/DBT to load data into a warehouse.

Target Warehouse:

BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift

Process:

Define ingestion jobs that:

Validate schema

Load new data daily from the data lake

Append to earthquakes_raw table in the data warehouse

🔧 4. Transformations (in Data Warehouse)
Use dbt to clean, filter, and prepare your data for analytics.

dbt models:

stg_earthquakes: Standardize column names/types

int_earthquake_locations: Create geo-region summaries

fct_quake_summary: Aggregated metrics by day, region, magnitude range

Transformations:

Convert timestamps to local time

Bucket magnitudes (e.g., 0–3: Low, 4–6: Medium, 7+: High)

Aggregate daily trends, most affected areas

📊 5. Dashboard Visualization
Use a BI tool to visualize the transformed data.

Options:

Power BI

Looker

Metabase

Tableau

Superset (open source)

Dashboard Features:

Map showing real-time quake locations

Trend line: number of earthquakes per day

Top 10 affected regions by average magnitude

Filters: date range, region, magnitude level
